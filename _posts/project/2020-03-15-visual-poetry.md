![Cover of Visual Poetry](/static/img/fun/vp00.jpg)

I always have the habit of bringing an analogue camera with me wherever I go. I use it to record places where I find the atmosphere impressive. Sometimes, when it arrives, I transform my feelings into loose stanzas of words.

This 56-page booklet is an attempt to mix these two ordinary practices and find a <mark>new formula of creation</mark> in between.
