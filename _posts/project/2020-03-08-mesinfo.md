# Problem
As **digital services** emerge, every day we create a huge amount of **personal data** across various providers. {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">📱💻⌚️📡</span>{% endraw %} Yet, we don't know what has been written on our names behind their gates. Why are we—the data generators—<mark>kept in the dark from our own data</mark> footprints online?

# Goal
This is what the think tank [Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération](https://fing.org/) (la Fing) and we believe: <mark>everyone shall be able to handle our own data, and make use of them for our own good!</mark>

Instead of being locked up in companies' 🔐 cryptic servers, the data that we create daily ought to be provided back to us; they should be as worthy and useful to the individuals as to the companies. 💪🏼

# Dive in
My team and I were the UX designers in this project to <mark>help promote and deliver benefits of self-ownership and self-governeance of personal data ('Self-Data’)</mark>. We worked with la Fing and [Cozy Cloud](https://cozy.io/)—an open-source, privacy by design, self-hosting ready storage architecture originated from France. We collaborated with their developers and solution architects to comprehend the functioning of a smart, personal data hub, the intricacies in the linkages & connectors, as well as the overall **data models**.

We evaluated the types of information and data generated in a contemporary digital daily life. That includes ☎️ telecom bills, 💰 banking entries, ⚡️ energy usage, 🚋 trasport expenditure, important papers such as 📜 insurances, as well as {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">📸🖼 multimedia</span>{% endraw %} input as familiar as our smartphones and 📊 activity trackers. From this point, our main job was to make these data speak to their owners—<mark>turn data into sense-making, enjoyable experiences to play with on a daily basis.</mark>

# Hands-on
To better understand how we can <mark>maximise the potentials of ‘self-data’</mark>, we conducted qualitative and quantitative **user research** to probe into the handling of personal data of dissimilar profiles, analysed their pain points and the missing hinges. We sought the possibilities to <mark>improve their individual digital management</mark> and address their needs.

After mapping user concerns against the platform's status quo, we ideated how we can <mark>convert personal data into functions with added value</mark> through Cozy Cloud as its unique selling points. We crystalised our findings in **use cases and personas**. Through an iterative process, we **wireframed new functions** for the platform and collected feedback from different stakeholders. In the end of our partnership, we presented over our prototype to Cozy Cloud & la Fing, pitched some further concepts, handed over an advisory report and a vision road map for subsequent development of the project.
