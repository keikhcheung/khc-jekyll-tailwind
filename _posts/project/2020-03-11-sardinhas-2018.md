# Backdrop
In 2018, I participated again in the annual <i>[Concurso Sardinhas](http://lisboanarua.com/blog/2018/02/15/esta-aberto-concurso-sardinhas-festas-lisboa-2018/)</i> organised by <i>Empresa de Gestão de Equipamentos e Animação Cultural</i> in celebration of <i>Festa de Lisboa</i>. This yearly contest consists of making art in the form of sardine.

# Concept
This year, I had the idea from the aminal nature of sardine—<mark>forage fish</mark>. In the ocean, sardines swim together in schools. They usuallly form a big group of fish to move around. {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">🐟🐠</span>{% endraw %} Of course deep down they are all different individuals. But together they are stronger.

I started with the idea of **immitating a child's drawing** fish in different colours. I then continued by exploring the combination of colours and the forms of representing sardines. I further tried bringing different sizes, thicknesses, positions, and postures of each together. I concluded on to the style of **🖌 Asian paintbrush** to represent their form.

Eventually, all the individually unique sardines formed a beautiful, lively *mosaic* of themselves. <mark>Together they are one!</mark>
