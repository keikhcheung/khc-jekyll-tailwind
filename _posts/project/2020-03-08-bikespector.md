# Problem
Can I count on my shared bike? 🚲

<mark>Shared mobility is good for urban dwellers</mark>. You don't need a bike (or car) if you just want to get from A to B. Sharing bikes saves us the money and the worry of losing one. But since everyone can take and go at any moment, it is **hard to rely on shared bikes** to plan your trip. Besides, what if it suddenly rains? ⛈

# Concept
Shared bikes being a means of transport, our team believe hirers should be given something more tangible to depend on, like a 🚇 metro or 🚌 bus **timetable**; and that should also take account of other factors which can affect its service, like 🌤 weather.

If shared bikes are as volatile as weather, can we *forecast* them with what we know?

# Hands-on
We made use of the **open data** of shared bikes in cities, before finally coming down to Cologne, Berlin, Düsseldorf and Frankfurt. I furthered our research by spotting possibile, compatible public release of data to broaden the prediction use case coverage. Together with weather data, we studied the **coorelation** between them while aiming at predicting bikes availability around a given address for the upcoming hours and days. Through the course of the analysis, this has been translated into 🤩 <mark>forecasting free shared bikes</mark> around a point—within a preferred walking distance—for the next hour up to 5 days ahead.

Our data specialists built a data model and applied machine learning methods. Over time, our model got trained to purify its <mark>prediction accuracy</mark>. We have been able to attain as high as **84%**. ✅

At the same time, I worked with our UI designers to develop an intereactive interface to **visualise** our bike prediction data. My role in this step was to ensure the story gets communicated & delivered, the platform is delightfully usable & useful, and the experience is consistent to what we expected across all platforms and devices. I conducted user tests and further iterated on our design together with our visual designers and front-end developers. We finally turned it into a serviceable tool open to public.

# Results
Now shared bikes users can <mark>better count on their local bike hire</mark> as a proper means of transport, and plan their trips with shared bikes in and around the city. **Shared mobility made reliable!** {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">😎🚲❤️</span>{% endraw %}
