# Challenge
This is an academic project to design and build a chair within 4 months.

I chose to explore the possibilities of a single, continuous line in relation with a chair; whether we could form <mark>a stable, sitting surface with only one line</mark>, while maintaining the aesthetic of its simplicity, standing its functional purposes, and satisfying the comfort of sitter(s).

# Hands-on
After an extensive research into physics, ergonomics and aesthetics, simulation prototyping and testing were conducted. I concluded on to one design for building the final chair.

The chair consists of two pieces of components: a **steel frame** in the form of a continuous line, and a **wooden plank** which could be laid on top to easily form a sitting surface. The sitting surface is elongated and designed to, for 🙋🏽‍♀️ one person, support both sitting and leaning, with an ergonomically curved armrest/back; the strength of the material would also allow {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏼‍♂️ two</span>{% endraw %} persons to sit on top of it at the same time.

I worked with iron and steel specialists and carpenters in their ateliers and workshops and realised the **1-to-1 chair prototype**.

The chair was tested and approved by peer students of the furniture design class as well as professors of the faculty.
