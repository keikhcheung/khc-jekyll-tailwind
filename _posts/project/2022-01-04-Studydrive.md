Studydrive is an an e-learning platform dedicated to university students in Europe. It is a place where study materials are shared, community help are offered to each other, and career opportunities are specifically provided to university students through connecting their specialities with leading companies in the industry.

My work at Studydrive stretches from all aspects of design, ranging from individual contribution through research and design phases to operational matters such as planning and team coordination.

As an expanding start-up, Studydrive has been in a transitional phase where ad hoc work needs scalability. I established the foundation of a **design system** with frond-end developers to implement **atomic design** to our user interface and raise platform parity. I set a common structure to our collective design assets to **raise collaborability and self-serviceability**. I also founded a cross-departmental research repository for **unlocking scopic research material** and **leveraging broader insights** for product planning.

On an organisational and operational level, I helped the Design Team transition from a squad of full-stack UX Designers into an orchestrated team of sepcialists. I also advocated problem-driven product development in the Product Team.

As a full-stack UX Designer, I am also involved in the finer, everyday tasks: user research, problem framing & insight discovery, UX/UI for web and application, data analytics, design system maintenance & development, collaborative design workshop facilitation, product strategy & advocation.

In addition, I repesented the company, co-hosted/spoke at a few events for different topics:
- Girls’ Day
- Personio H.U.G
