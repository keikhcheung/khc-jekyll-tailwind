Studydrive is an an e-learning platform dedicated to university students in Europe. It is a place where study materials are shared, community help are offered to each other, and career opportunities are specifically provided to university students through connecting their specialities with leading companies in the industry.

My work at Studydrive stretches from all aspects of design, ranging from individual contribution through research and design phases to operational matters such as planning and team coordination.

As an expanding start-up, Studydrive has been in a transitional phase where ad hoc work needs scalability. I established the foundation of a **design system** with frond-end developers to implement **atomic design** to our user interface and raise platform parity. I set a common structure to our collective design assets to **raise collaborability and self-serviceability**. I also founded a cross-departmental research repository for **unlocking scopic research material** and **leveraging broader insights** for product planning.

On an organisational and operational level, I helped the Design Team transition from a squad of full-stack UX Designers into an orchestrated team of sepcialists. I also advocated problem-driven product development in the Product Team.

As a full-stack UX Designer, I am also involved in the finer, everyday tasks: user research, problem framing & insight discovery, UX/UI for web and application, data analytics, design system maintenance & development, collaborative design workshop facilitation, product strategy & advocation.

## Design system

Design system is the common playground for designers and engineers. When space and files are common, things can get messy and misinterpreted, especially in a remote work setting. The challenge to a successful design system is establishing and maintaining a shared understanding.

At Studydrive, I reviewed existing design pattern libraries and their application, aligned behavioral patterns of interaction across platforms, refactored them them into a self-serviceable toolbox for both designers and enginneers, and closed gaps between design and implementation.

## Research repository

As Studydrive scales, different departments have held their own research initiatives to better understand the market, our student users and our customers in order to identify emerging potentials and improve our products. Although insightful, acquired knowledge does not always get across different teams and, hence, its application could remain localised and limited. Without an open access, similar research may even be repeated separately. This creates waste in resources.

To help resolve this problem, I conducted an internal probe into different departments’ research habit. For example, Marketing Team relies a lot on quantative performance reports whilst Design Team shares a fifty-fifty importance in performance statistics and quanlitative feedback.

With these nuances in mind, I designed a tag system for labellling acquired knowledge, upon which everyone can query source information for supporting their work. The tag system *maximises discoverability* and allows *flexibility to grow*. This becomes a common place where research is shared and where broader insights are knitted and leveraged for product iteration.

[Looking across how other companies like Uber and Spotify practise their research] Research insights now also come with templates, where findings can be atomically documented, presented in palatable & digestible doses, and mobilised for insight-driven product development.

An accessible-for-all research repository lengthens the longevity of research findings and supports decision-making on product strategy and company planning.

## Problem-based product development

In addition, I repesented the company, co-hosted/spoke at a few events for different topics:
- Girls’ Day
- Personio H.U.G
