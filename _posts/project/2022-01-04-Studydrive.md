Studydrive is an an e-learning platform dedicated to university students in Europe. It is a place where study materials are shared, community help are offered to each other, and career opportunities are specifically provided to university students through connecting their specialities with leading companies in the industry.

My work at Studydrive stretches from all aspects of design, ranging from individual contribution through research and design phases to operational matters such as planning and team coordination.

As an expanding start-up, Studydrive has been in a transitional phase where ad hoc work needs scalability. I established the foundation of a **design system** with frond-end developers to implement **atomic design** to our user interface and raise platform parity. I set a common structure to our collective design assets to **raise collaborability and self-serviceability**. I also founded a cross-departmental research repository for **unlocking scopic research material** and **leveraging broader insights** for product planning.

On an organisational and operational level, I helped the Design Team transition from a squad of full-stack UX Designers into an orchestrated team of sepcialists. I also advocated problem-driven product development in the Product Team.

As a full-stack UX Designer, I am also involved in the finer, everyday tasks: user research, problem framing & insight discovery, UX/UI for web and application, data analytics, design system maintenance & development, collaborative design workshop facilitation, product strategy & advocation.

## Design system

Design system is the common playground for designers and engineers. When space and files are common, things can get messy and misinterpreted, especially in a remote work setting. The challenge to a successful design system is establishing and maintaining a shared understanding.

At Studydrive, I reviewed existing design pattern libraries originally built on single-player Sketch, evaluated UI components’ application, aligned behavioral patterns of interaction across platforms, and refactored them into an open-by-default, self-serviceable toolbox on Figma for both designers and enginneers. This has helped us close gaps between design and implementation.

Through emerging use cases, technical requirements updates and iterative code review, I continued adapting our design system to cater for our designers’ and eingineers’ needs. This keeps the design system active, up to date and relevant to design’s and front-end development’s workspaces.


## Research repository

As Studydrive scales, different departments have held their own research initiatives to better understand the market, our student users and our customers in order to identify emerging potentials and improve our products. However, research is mostly conducted in one-off projects and archived after report. Although insightful, acquired knowledge does not always get across different teams. Hence, the application of what is learnt could remain localised and limited. Without an open access, similar research may even be repeated separately. This creates waste in resources.

How might we create a better knowledge base for everyone at Studydrive?

To help resolve this problem, I conducted an internal probe into different departments’ research habit. For example, Marketing Team relies a lot on quantative performance reports whilst Design Team shares a fifty-fifty importance in performance statistics and quanlitative feedback.

Gauging the different needs and habits. I further identified root causes and framed problems emerging from research practices and knowledge consumption at Studydrive. Hypothising potential solutions to make research outcome more accessible & actionable—and also research practice more convenient—I benchmarked solutions available in the market against our needs and budget. In the end, Dovetail has been chosen to be our base for a company-wide research repository.

With the nuances of different needs in mind, I created a tag system for labellling acquired knowledge. The tag system *maximises discoverability* and allows *flexibility to grow*. It allows everyone to build *modular queries for raw data*, putting structured evidence and source information right at only a few clicks. Taxonomy from explorative research projects may have its space to evolve organically with the examined context, whereas evaluative research projects could easily fit collected data into metrics attributes and journey parts, for instance.

[Looking across how other companies like Uber and Spotify practise their research] To make research approachable, digestible and actionable, I had to rethink how research is supposed to bring insights to the company’s workflow. Often was research so embedded in a specific project context that it became difficult to apply elsewhere. The volumn of insights released at the end could also be immobilising.

* Digestible: Shrink research insights into smaller, frequent doses.
* Approachable: Turn research insights into on-demand self-service. Make them scannable. So that the audience can dive into learning at their choice of time and attention spans.
* Actionable: Relate what we learn to what we can do. Suggest action items to move forward on every piece of knowledge. What can this lesson enable us?

Research insights now also come in atomic doses with standardised templates. Content-rich evidence can be joined as interactive findings. Insights can written and presented in palatable portions that invite discussions.

With the research repository, user and numbers are brought closer to co-workers at Studydrive.
It becomes a common place where knowledge is knitted and leveraged for iterative product development. It brings better exposure and acknowledgement to research practices by inviting people to participate, and lengthens the longevity of our learning. It supports work across projects & departments and enables better strategic planning through informed decision-making.
