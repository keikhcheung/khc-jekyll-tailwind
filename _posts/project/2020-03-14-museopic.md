# Problem
**Museum curators** spend a lot of time and effort in organising an exhibition. Once it is launched, they are often already on the go again for the next one and have little time to **optimise current show**. How can we help them <mark>get the most out of every exhibition?</mark>

# Backdrop
[MuseoPic](http://www.museopic.com) is a smartphoen application which enhances ordinary museum visits. Through **augmented reality**, visitors can interact with exhibits, learn more about their story behind, and create their own collections. It has been deployed in contemporary art, design, and natural sciences museums in üá´üá∑¬†Lyon areas[^1].

MuseoPic Analytics captures visitors' interaction with exhibits and <mark>transform that data into useful insights</mark> for museum personnel, so that they can easily understand their current programme's performance & settings, and make adaptation right away. This help them better align exhibitions with their visitors, raise discoverability and engagement, maximise üéü¬†box office sales as well as ‚≠êÔ∏è¬†public reviews, and better develop content management and strategy.

# Hands-on
My team and I were the UX designers on this project. In order to better understand the organisation and typical workflow of museums, we conducted several **interviews with our target users**, namely the museum directors, quality control attach√©s and content managers.

We then analysed their actions & needs regarding the life cycle of exhibitions and extracted their **jobs-to-be-done (JTBDs)**. We framed some major challenges & problems and mapped some üéà¬†opportunities where MuseoPic Analytics could help them.

Following the evolution of ideas, we clustered them in **use case scenarios**. We actively involved our users and stakeholders for comments, feedback and technical checks while iterating our design cycles to create **mock-ups for the analytics platform**.

In the end of our partnership, we packaged our findings and handed off our prototypes with UX strategy advice to our client.
