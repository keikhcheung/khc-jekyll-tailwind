# Problem
**Collaborative work** can be tough when you do not share the same vision… especially when you are <mark>5,000+ altogether across the world!?</mark> {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">🌎🌍🌏</span>{% endraw %}

# Status quo
[TÜV Rheinland](https://www.tuv.com/) is a 145-year-old-and-growing certification service provider for all kinds of technical standards, ranging from 🧸 baby toys to 🚜 heavy machinery. It holds offices worldwide and works with test centres & laboratories across continents.

To guarantee quality and security, products are examined and tested comprehensively at TÜV, often at the best situations in different {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">👨🏻‍🔬 regional</span>{% endraw %} labs. Hence, <mark>delegation, coordination & management</mark> between divisions are crucial to their success and competitiveness.

But protocols and consensus do not always come naturally. Departments have developed their unique ways of work over time. A *shared standard work tool* along the international production becomes necessary to bring people and work together. {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏾‍♂️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏼‍♂️</span>{% endraw %}

# Concept
That's how ComPASS came to life! ComPASS is a **workflow platform** tailor-made for TÜV's global business. It accompanies their various teams through their production process and 🧭 <mark>provide orientation</mark> to players on complex projects. From order placement & analysis, labour division & cooperation, to lab tests, reports & follow-ups—every pace is incorporated and taken care of on ComPASS.

# Hands-on
As part of the UX/UI team, we met with their international business and technical departments to conduct **🔍 user research**. By understanding, analysing and mapping their process, roles and journeys, we identified their bottlenecks & pain points, spotted necessary modifications & alignment, and discovered insights in how to <mark>digitise, innovate & reshape their global workflow</mark>, all and while attending to their jobs-to-be-done and needs. At the same time, we tried to tactically find the common ground for geographical **work culture & habits**. Through iterative design and development process, we gradually converted an ambitious idea with complexities into a flexible, scalable collaboration system which not only consolidates their business as a whole, but also tones in well with different team players across the board. {% raw %}<span style="display: inline-block">⛹🏻‍♀️⛹🏽‍♂️</span>{% endraw %}

We worked in an *intercontinental dual-track agile team* across seven locations: 🇯🇵 Yokohama, 🇭🇰 Hong Kong, 🇨🇳 Shanghai, 🇹🇼 Taipei, 🇬🇧 London, 🇩🇪 Nuremberg, and 🇩🇪 Cologne. Our major responsibility was design exploration and insight discovery. I also closely worked with developers in the project team to guarantee our concepts' delivery and end product quality. Altogether we were building the ComPASS platform and simultaneously **developing a design system** for TÜV Rheinland for their other forthcoming digital products.
